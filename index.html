	<p>About Us:</p>
	<p>We are a small team of DangerZone players / modders who enjoy doing stupid stuff. We formed when "Cainho" DMed DeBeast
		saying that it would be cool if there was a DZ server, so DeBeast talked to TheyCallMeDanger about it. Later Danger said
		that he enjoys building computers, so DeBeast (As a joke) said "build us a computer for a server" and he actually agreed
		to it, then DeBeast and Cainho got a small team of people we wanted to join the server, we ended up with Cainho, Danger,
		Spooder Man / DiamondKidd, WeirdNerd / InvalidName, Xahann, and DeBeast591. Later, DeBeast asked if the team should be
		renamed from just "duck smp" to "the quackpack" and we agreed to it.</p>
